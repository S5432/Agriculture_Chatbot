## Project Title: üöú Agricultural Chatbot for Farmers

Welcome to the **Agricultural Chatbot** project! This chatbot is designed to help farmers by answering common agricultural questions related to crops like beans, maize, and cassava. It uses **cosine similarity** to match users' questions with pre-defined questions and provide helpful answers.

## ü§ñ How It Works

The chatbot uses **cosine similarity** to understand and match your questions with pre-defined questions in a dataset. Here's how it works:

1. **User Input**: You type in your question.
2. **Tokenization**: The chatbot breaks the text into individual words (tokens).
3. **Stopword Removal**: Unimportant words (like "is", "the", etc.) are removed.
4. **Cosine Similarity**: The chatbot calculates how similar your question is to its list of pre-defined questions.
5. **Response**: If a match is found, it will respond with the relevant answer. If not, it will say, "We can't answer this."

## üå± Future Improvements

While this chatbot is already helpful, there are a few ways we can make it even better:

- **Advanced Matching**: Use more complex algorithms for better question matching.
- **Better Understanding**: Integrate NLP techniques for smarter question understanding.
- **Feedback System**: Let users rate the chatbot‚Äôs answers to improve its performance.
- **AI Integration**: Connect to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to generate dynamic answers when no match is found.

## üöÄ Future Scope

- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages to help farmers worldwide.
- **Voice Integration**: Allow farmers to interact with the chatbot using voice commands.
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrate with weather or pest outbreak APIs to give real-time agricultural advice.
- **Mobile App**: Build a mobile app for easy access on-the-go for farmers in rural areas.
